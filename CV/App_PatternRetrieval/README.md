# SURF-Based Image Processing Tool

## Introduction
This project is a Python-based tool for image processing utilizing the SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features) algorithm. It's designed for feature extraction, feature matching, and image retrieval tasks, leveraging the power of the OpenCV library. This tool is ideal for applications in computer vision, image analysis, and similar fields.

## Features
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracts SURF features from images, which are robust and useful for various image processing tasks.
- **Feature Matching**: Computes matches between features in different images, useful in applications like object recognition and image stitching.
- **Image Retrieval**: Performs image retrieval by comparing the SURF features of an input image with those in a database of images.

## Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library with contrib modules (for SURF)

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone []
```

## Usage
1. Place your images in the desired folder.
2. Run the script and provide the path to your images.
   ```
   python SURF-HistFilter.py
   ```
